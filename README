The source code of iPhone app "MusicPlayer"

Welcome to download :)

This is a free source code. You can use it in your own project.

I hope this project will give you some help.

I'm only a middle school student, so I only can see your feedback on weekends.

This is the first beta version of this app, and I will update it when I'm free.

If you have a GitHub account please CLONE this Git instead of download the zip file.
